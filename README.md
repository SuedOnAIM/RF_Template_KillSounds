Questions and Answers 

(except i made up the questions before ever releasing the mod or announcing this github so it's all assumptions of questions viewers will ask)
___________________________________________________________

**Q: How is this different than RadioactiveJellyfish's Team Voices?**
A: This mod plays a sound whenever you kill an enemy and it can be heard from anywhere. Jelly's mutator plays the sound locally so if you kill an enemy from 500 meters away, you won't be hearing their death cry.


***Q: Will you add Hitmarker replacing?***

A: No. The vanilla Ravenfield Hitmarkers work fine enough and I'm too lazy to find out how to only disable the vanilla audiosource and not the entire hitmarker. If you're really desperate, learn how to make a hitmarker replacement script from RadioactiveJellyfish's player voice code. https://github.com/RadioactiveJelly/ravenfield-player-voice

***Q: Why doesn't it work when killing teammates?***

A: You don't get rewarded for killing teammates in other shooters. Why would you be rewarded here.

***Q: Can I request a kill sound?***

A: You can, and you will be ignored. The point of releasing the template was so other people could make their own kill sound without begging me for one.


***Q: Help! I don't know what I'm doing! :(***

A: Skill issue. I made this template to be as easy to use as possible. Go watch Unity tutorials on YouTube if you can't even manage to import an audio file on your own.


***Q: Why does my kill sound, well, sound wrong?***

A: I edited most kill sounds I used to be shorter and to get to the main "impact" of the sound quicker. You, the player, know you killed an enemy, but the delay between your action and the auditory confirmation makes the kill sound feel wrong. Making it quicker is more satisfying on a "game feel" level.


***Q: Any secret tips you can give for making the audio?***

A: I use Audacity for most of my audio editing needs. I'd also recommend learning how to use Audacity's Macro tool to automate tedious tasks like converting all audio files to .OGG
