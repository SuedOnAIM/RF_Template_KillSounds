FAQ 
(except i made up the questions before ever releasing the mod or announcing this github so it's all assumptions of questions viewers will ask)
___________________________________________________________

Q: How is this different than RadioactiveJellyfish's Team Voices?
A: This mod plays a sound whenever you kill an enemy and it can be heard from anywhere. Jelly's mutator plays the sound locally so if you kill an enemy from 500 meters away, you won't be hearing their death cry.

Q: Will you add Hitmarker replacing?
A: No. The vanilla Ravenfield Hitmarkers work fine enough and I'm too lazy to find out how to only disable the vanilla audiosource and not the entire hitmarker.

Q: Can I request a kill sound?
A: You can, and you will be ignored. The point of releasing the template was so other people could make their own kill sound without begging me for one.
